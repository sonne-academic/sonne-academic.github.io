            This is google scholar, when searching for an author.
            We find over 1000 publications for tim dwyer.
            But as soon as we want to sort by recent publications, we're down to 19.
            Google also does not provide information about references.

            So I built my own search engine with data from Semantic Scholar, Microsoft Academic Graph and dblp.
            I called it "sonne", because its database is Apache Solr.
            Its primary purpose is exploration of unfamiliar fields of study.
            So let's say, I'm interested in graph layout...

            Once I got the search results, I sort them by citation count.
            And since I'm still researching, I want to know more about the journal this was published in.
            Which is fortunately a journal for surveys so I feel lucky!
            I can unfold all the publications that were published in there...
            ... which does not help much, for graph layout.

            is search for "layout" and select two of the papers.
            I can then check out where one of them was cited by, and what it's referencing.
            Here, I don't see anything particularly interesting, but one of the references was cited really often.
            So this piques my interest.
            The last author is interesting, because I know Rivest from my cryptography classes.
            And with that, let's get into more advanced features:

          <aside class="notes">
            From Rivest, I know there are at least two other researchers that they cooperated with.
            So let's look at the popular publications.
            My suspicion that the RSA paper was high up is confirmed, and here we find Adelman and Shamir.
            But when I look at how often they cooperated, I can see that
            Adelman and Shamir aren't as high up in this list as I thought, so I learnt something.
            Since that assumption played out poorly, I wonder where they published most?
            Oh, he even published through the arXiv?

            But now, how do I find the papers he published at the ACM Comms?
            I could just filter for "rivest" just like I did beforehand for "layout".
            But then again, I can select both of them and see the result like this!
            Let's check out the first three popular papers.
            Then remove one of the links and redo the layout, otherwise this is a little to crowded.

            So apart from my mindless wandering, we can reconstruct how we got here.
            This is especially important when you're breaking into new fields.

            A breadth first search is often necessary to learn new technical terms.
            To get an overview, I want to track the relations between papers.
            Sure you could do that with mind maps, but I find the extra labor annoying.
            Now I have it integrated into the searching process, which is much nicer.
            Remember how I complained that other engines don't allow me to do other queries?

            I really don't remember when I last read a book this long, but much functionality needs much documentation.
            I think I read the documentation at least three times, and I'm still not sure about some details.
