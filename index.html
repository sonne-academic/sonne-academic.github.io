          Hello!
          Just so you know what you're in for:
          We'll first look at other academic search engines and why I don't like them.
          Then I'll show you what I built, how it works and what challenges I faced.
          Just after, I tell you a bit about the evaluation and then there's time for questions.

            This is google scholar, when searching for an author.
            We find over 1000 publications for tim dwyer.

            Google also does not provide information about references.

            So I built my own search engine with data from Semantic Scholar, Microsoft Academic Graph and dblp.
            I called it "sonne", because its database is Apache Solr.
            Its primary purpose is exploration of unfamiliar fields of study.
            So let's say, I'm interested in graph layout...

            ... which i search for here.
            Once I got the search results, I sort them by citation count.
            And since I'm still researching, I want to know more about the journal this was published in.
            Which is fortunately a journal for surveys so I feel lucky!
            I can unfold all the publications that were published in there...
            ... which does not help much, for graph layout.
            So what I can do here, ...

            is search for "layout" and select two of the papers.
            I can then check out where one of them was cited by, and what it's referencing.
            Here, I don't see anything particularly interesting, but one of the references was cited really often.
            So this piques my interest.
            The last author is interesting, because I know Rivest from my cryptography classes.
            And with that, let's get into more advanced features:

          <aside class="notes">
            From Rivest, I know there are at least two other researchers that they cooperated with.
            So let's look at the popular publications.
            My suspicion that the RSA paper was high up is confirmed, and here we find Adelman and Shamir.
            But when I look at how often they cooperated, I can see that
            Adelman and Shamir aren't as high up in this list as I thought, so I learnt something.
            Since that assumption played out poorly, I wonder where they published most?
            Oh, he even published through the arXiv?

          <aside class="notes">
            But now, how do I find the papers he published at the ACM Comms?
            I could just filter for "rivest" just like I did beforehand for "layout".
            But then again, I can select both of them and see the result like this!
            Let's check out the first three popular papers.
            Then remove one of the links and redo the layout, otherwise this is a little to crowded.

            I might as well add Shamir and Adleman to the selection, so here we go.

            This file is over 560 million lines long and contains this information.
            But how do we go about that?
            We need random access to look up the author information, but we can't fit it into RAM trivially.
            Well, my solution was to index everything in solr, and then read it all back.
            It's not very straightforward and it took 32 hours, but it worked.

            I wrote the mailing lists, if somebody could help here.

            seven researchers from computer science solved small tasks,
            like finding intersections of author to journals.
            I watched them and helped, when necessary.
            It turned out, that some of the UI choices I made were counter-intuitive,
            so the feedback was incredibly valuable and I changed it for the better.
